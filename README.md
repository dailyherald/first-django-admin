My first django admin

http://first-django-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

=================

Pip freeze - lists all the things in your virtual env for use in a requirements.txt file

pip freeze > requirements.txt (makes the requirements file)

pip install -r requirements.txt (installs it all)

migrate - nerd jargon for working with the structure of the database. 

python manage.py migrate - creates the database, with django stuff by default
